### User stories

#### MVP

- As a user I want to be able to , so that .
- As a user I want to be able to access a stroke questionnaire, so that I can recognize a stroke in myself or others..
- As a user I want to be able to record answers to the stroke questionnaire, so that I have a detailed record of symptoms to show the doctors in the ER.
- As a user I want to be able to create an account, so that I have the option/ability to view previous event notes in follow up care visits. .
- As a user I want to be able to see my form response notes on a finished screen, so that I can just screenshot the response answers if the account creation feels like a hindrance or unnecessary.
- As a user I want to be able to see an about page that explains strokes and the background of the app, so that I can learn more about strokes, and have reassurance for the validity of the app.
- As a user I want to be able to only see event logs associated with my username if I’m logged in, so that my privacy and event history is protected.

#### Stretch

- As a user I want to be able to see the time I started the form, so that I do not have to rely on just myself to record important information.
- As a user I want to be able to Update and Destroy old event logs, so that I have agency over my personal information and can add notes to the log if I remember something important later that I didn’t think to write down.
- As a user I want the ability to edit my account information or delete my account, so that I can still access information if I forget the password or delete my account if necessary.
